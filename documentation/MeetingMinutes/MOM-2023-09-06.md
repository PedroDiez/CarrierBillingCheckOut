### Items Discussion

Item | Discussion
---- | ---- 
WG Status | So far, **initial v0.2.0-wip is merged** including mainly filtering rules to common proposal. Next steps are dependant on output from commonalities (Notifications, securitySchemas, datetime format,...). It is expected to begin to work in a consistent v0.2.0 at the end of september so as it probably can be tagged as the first release of Carrier Billing (will talk at that time).
[Issue#93](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/93) | Documentation Update in Carrier Billing WG. Work offline between Orange (Ludovic) and Telefonica (Pedro) to manage pending actions and distribute work. 2 PR have been triggered:<br> • [PR#99](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/99) to remove documentation no longer required - some documentation will be removed once we complete the yaml documentation of the API spec.<br> • [PR#100](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/100) to remove checkout word + update Model.<br> Both PRs were cross-reviewed by Ludovic and Pedro respectively and gave OK. They have been MERGED after the meeting. Issue is CLOSED.
[Issue#97](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/97) | Improvements for Carrier Billing. Two topics raised: <br> • **Enhancement of the look & feel**. Pedro indicates not able to address look&feel situation in other APIs. So Look & feel across API will be done later and resume this topic of the issue.<br><br> • **Notifications design**. Waiting to commonalities outcomes. Related to Commonalities Issues [#8](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/8) and [#44](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/44). Pending on the output of those issues, related PRs are [Commonalities-PR#43](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/pull/43) and [Commonalities-PR#56](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/pull/56) respectively.
[Issue#101](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/101) | Understood the rationale of the issue. Pedro (Telefonica) comments HTTP headers are case insensitive so both Uppercase and lowercase are valid. Ludovic (Orange) closed the issue after the meeting. Issue is CLOSED
