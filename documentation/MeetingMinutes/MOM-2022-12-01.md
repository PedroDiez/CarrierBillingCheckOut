[Issue 20](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/20) | MoM available in [Pull Request 19](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/19). Agreed but cannot be merged after activation of merging rules. Ludovic (Orange) kindly offers to be codeowner. Requested in [Pull Request 22](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/22)
[Issue 10](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/10) | PR content is agreed [Pull Request 18](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/18). Pending to be approved to be merged.
[Pull Request 7](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/7) | CLOSED. Agreed initial input from STC and merged after the meeting.<br/> • Orange proposes to generate 4 User Stories (User Stories for 1-STEP and 2-STEP procedures and User Stories for Retrieve Details of a Payment and List Payments based in some criteria).<br/> • Accepted in the meeting and Orange will make proposal
[Issue 21](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/20) | Opened to reflect current status of two different proposals presented by Telefonica and Orange that cannot be accepted each other. Commented in the meeting that this issue is open to provide free opinion from other participants about any preference. Tomorrow it will be a call to discuss about rules/procedures regading this type of situations. Waiting to have guidance to move forward. Some discussion around this:<br/> • STC asks about how to deal with OTP in proposal from Orange and the need of merchant information to be mandatory.<br/> • Orange comments that merchant information can be accomodated and regarding OTP validation they see as a separate functionality implemented via a MC-based solution.<br/> • Telefonica indicates in its proposal OTP validation is internally triggered as Backend Logic (generating SMS towards user) and API returns URL where OTP can be validated. 


### Next Steps
- Approval of Pull Request 22 to deal with weekly activities within WG (needed at least two "operative" codeowners)
- Approval of Pull Requests 18 and 19
- Next meeting 07/DEC
