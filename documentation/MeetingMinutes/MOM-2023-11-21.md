### Items Discussion

Item | Discussion
---- | ---- 
[PR#119](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/119) | Pull Request triggered to cover Issues: [Issue#97](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/97), [Issue#105](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/105), [Issue#106](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/106), [Issue#107](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/107), [Issue#108](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/108), [Issue#112](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/112).<br> Pull request is `MERGED` so as related issues are `CLOSED`. This is the first of the two PRs in order to reach a stable v0.2.0 version.
[Issue#109](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/109) | WG Agreement for this issue to be **managed in the new next PR**.
[Issue#110](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/110) | Impact already identified is aligned: <br> • New event type "denied" (probably suitable wording is payment-denied). <br> • New event type "pending_validation" (in the joint anaylisis per [Issue#116](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/116)).<br> • New Exception 403 CARRIER_BILLING.PAYMENT_DENIED in some operations (this also addresses [Issue#117](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/117)).<br> During meeting open point about "denied" event is aligned and optional parameter to indicate denialReason (string) is agreed to be considered. Then, this issue will be **managed in the next PR**.<br> Ludovic (Orange) also comments that currently we have only implicit subscription so adding this denialEvent is fine, but to keep in mind that if we add explicit subscription pattern in future then we can assess event type granularity:<br> • Keep event type per state or<br> • Have one generic event type for payment state change.
[Issue#111](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/111) | Telefonica proposal approach 1 is seen as better approach. Regarding if additional error should be managed, Pedro (Telefónica) explains the case for FrontEnd Flow (auth_code) -not for Backend Flow (CIBA)- in case we are unable to get the phoneNumber from the access token or if the phoneNumber retrieved from the token is distinct from the one is the payload, so as new 403 Exception is considered (Details in Issue). Ludovic indicates it is fine to consider this case. Then, this issue will be **managed in the next PR**.
[Issue#116](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/116) | This issue was covered in the last meeting. Very small request from Ludovic (Orange) to add (1S/2S) in first 2 transitions diagram clarified during the meeting. Pedro will update source code and image within the issue and will trigger a specific PR for the diagram so as link can be used directly. This issue will be **managed in the next PR**.
[Issue#117](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/117) | It will be managed with the [Issue#110](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/110) so as no new exception would be required.
AoB | **WG objective:**<br> • Carrier Billing v0.2.0 Release Candidate covering all these points handled during today's meeting.<br> • Refund & other function will be cover in following release.<br><br>**Test definition:** Topic commented by Rafał (Deutsche Telekom) and Ludovic (Orange) It will be required to address the test definition in this WG but first need to have a global agreement of the format for the test definition. [Commonalities/Issue#94](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/94).<br><br>**Test Filtering GET**: Topic commented by Rafał (Deutsche Telekom), [Commonalities/Issue#10](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/10), [Commonalities/PR#82]([https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/pull/82). Discussion on the filtering criteria, Rafał has prepared a PR in commonalities based on the issue opened. Pedro indicates from Telefónica side it was alignment with Rubén, so as (`gte,gt,lte,lt,eq`) applies for both numeric and dates but no makes sense for enumerated fields (only eq). Rubén also proposed `neq` as the opposite of `eq`. There is some discussion on alignment with TMF pattern (TMF Forum works with URL encoded value of `logical condition` but in CAMARA we are adding suffix to the filtering criteria parameter when applicable. Ludovic raised the point of discrepancy risks between CAMARA & Operate from Channel partner perspective and will also comment in Commonalities issue.<br><br>**Next Steps**: Meeting in 4th December week will be moved to 12th-December (Pedro is on holidays that week) and if needed meeting in 18th December week will be hosted. In the meantime, new PR will be triggered (Pedro) to cover pending points at least during 27th November week in order to have time for its review.
