### Items Discussion

Item | Discussion
---- | ---- 
[PR#120](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/120) | PR triggered by Deutsche Telekom (Rafał) in order to align WG repository with the guidelines of CAMARA regarding [Testing Folder](https://github.com/camaraproject/Template_Lead_Repository/pull/1). Reviewed and approved by Orange and Telefonica. `MERGED` during the meeting.
[PR#119](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/119) | Pull Request triggered to cover Issues: [Issue#97](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/97), [Issue#105](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/105), [Issue#106](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/106), [Issue#107](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/107), [Issue#108](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/108), [Issue#112](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/112). Explained during the meeting the impacts in API yaml spec. Main points covered:<br> • Enhance the documentation (from previous documentation & other APIs).<br> • Alignment for security scheme & scope. We have distinct scope for create the payment (create), for confirm/cancel in 2 steps (write) and a third (read) for getting the data.<br> • Notification alignment with CloudEvents model (QoD/Device Status used as template/references).<br> • Added 404 for confirm/cancel payment.<br> • Amount precision with 3 decimals.<br> Some comments already provided by Ludovic (Orange) and Rafał (Deutsche Telekom) to be managed. They will check/review in deep during the next days. Regarding the point about "x-correlator" it will be managed within Commonalities. 
[Issue#109](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/109) | Telefonica proposal indicated within the issue is agreed by Orange. Therefore this issue will be **managed in the new next PR**.
[Issue#110](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/110) | Explained the output identified so far in the issue: <br> • New event type "denied". <br> • New event type "pending_validation" (in the joint anaylisis per [Issue#116](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/116)).<br> • New Exception 403 CARRIER_BILLING.PAYMENT_DENIED in some operations (this also addresses [Issue#117](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/117)).<br> Open point: Having a specific attribute for "denied" reason. Work offline to compile common cases.<br> Issue will be reviewed by Orange and Deutsche Telekom.
[Issue#111](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/111) | Telefonica proposal (approach 1) looks good for Orange. Deutsche Telekom will review offline. It mainly implies documentation but Telefonica (Pedro) will check if additional error should be managed.
[Issue#116](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/116) | Explained the rationale/objective of the issue during the meeting. There may be business scenarios in 2-STEP Payment whether OTP validation procedure is required (because UI associated to OTP validation is built by merchant). Therefore, it is proposed an enhancement in `preparePayment` response regarding validationInfo model and also a new optional method validatePayment. Associated state transitions are also mentioned within the Issue. NOTES:<br> • State change lifecycle diagram must be reviewed.<br> • (1STEP/2STEP) should be added in all transitions (missing on the first 2). <br> Issue will be reviewed offline by Orange and Deutsche Telekom.
[Issue#117](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/117) | It will be managed with the [Issue#110](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/110) so as no new exception would be required.
AoB | WG objective:<br> • Carrier Billing v0.2.0 Release Candidate will cover all these points handled during today's meeting.<br> • Refund & other function will be cover in following release.
