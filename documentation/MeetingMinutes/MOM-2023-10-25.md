### Items Discussion

Item | Discussion
---- | ---- 
[Issue#97](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/97) | Improvements for Carrier Billing. Limited scope to topic of **Enhancement of the look & feel**. Action Point to Pedro to provide info to the WG. Feedback provided and documented in the issue, identifying in main relevant CAMARA API the model with specific object schema is used for specific Exceptions. Therefore, adopting this model in Carrier Billing as well. Agreed by the WG and it will be **integrated in next PR**.
[Issue#104](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/104) | This feature will be addressed later, after having consistent 1-STEP and 2-STEP Payment models.
[Issue#105](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/105) | Telefónica provides internal analysis, indicating current billing systems works naturally with "decimals", so this model would have huge impact. Orange thinks the same, will check internally for confirmation.<br> Nevertheless the issue points the topic of addressing 3 decimals in some currencies/countries, so we need to redefine `amount` model to have 3 digits to cover some UC (i.e. worldwide interoperability). This can be done by indicating `multipleOf: 0.001` in `amount` format as this concept in OAS3 indicates the step between two consequent values, so up to 3 decimal digits can be addressed (NOTE that 5,450 is equal to 5,45 OR 6,000 is equal to 6, as float covers integers per definition). In addition to that, an implementation could specifically throw error if they manage 0, 1 or 2 decimal. Agreed on this way forward. It will be **integrated in the next PR**.  
[Issue#106](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/106) | Agreed by the team. It will be **integrated in the next PR**.
[Issue#107](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/107) | Agreed by the team. It will be **integrated in the next PR**.
[Issue#108](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/108) | Dealing with two Commonalities topics alignment:<br> • **securitySchema**: mention to openId connect could be done in the yaml with the notice that this is not yet completely validated. Discussion ongoing in Commonalities and Identity&Consent Management. <br> • **scopes**: scope will be **integrated in the next PR**.
[Issue#109](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/109) | Issue commented during last meeting. Pedro comments besides indicating page, perPage default values in API spec, it makes sense to have an exception to manage uncoherent situations from API Server side (invalid params combination). Ludovic nuances the comment was not about wrong combination but to send an exception when too many record matches, and it will provide feedback within the issue. Discussion continues in the Issue before taking next steps.
[Issue#110](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/110) | So far, potential impacts identified are: <br> • Exception 403 Payment Denied for two-step confirmPayment<br> • New event for Payment denied.<br> However, in order to not missed anything, it is better to detail the status transitions in every scenario (1-STEP and 2-STEP), so we get two objectives:<br> • Having an aligned understanding of the status transitions and document it within API. Identify design actions in the API (new events, exceptions,...).<br> • Identify whether state machine needs also to be updated.<br> Pedro will draft some documentation within the Issue for alignment and discussion. Discussion continues in the Issue before taking next steps.
[Issue#111](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/111) | Telefonica comments the issue in order to indicate the feature of retrieve payment(s) refer to the context of a given phone number. Orange comments there are also Use Cases where API client (App) can obtain information not on behalf of a given user phone number. In API there is no phone number as parameter. This topic requires more discussion and aligment. Comments are welcome for the next meeting.  
[Issue#112](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/112) | Agreed by the team. It will be **integrated in the next PR**.
[Issue#114](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/114) | Initial discussion during the meeting. STC comments the issue indicating it has both business and security implications: <br> • For recurring payment the OTP will not be required.<br> • Security perspective, having impact in Token lifetime.<br> Orange indicates this process is managed first with the creation of a product order that represents the subscription and after that, periodical post payments are performed.<br> Telefonica indicates probably the Business view on this procedure may be different in Telco Operators so an aligment from Product Perspective is probably required in GSMA OGW product track to have guidance on this matter. 
[Issue#115](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/115) | Issue introduced during last meeting. Telefonica has commented internally to Business due to the relationship with Refund procedure, as they are elaborating the refunds requirements. In the same fashion as former issue, it is probably required an alignment in GSMA OGW product track to have guidance on this matter.
[Issue#116](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/116) | Not covered in the meeting.
[Issue#117](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/117) | Not covered in the meeting.
