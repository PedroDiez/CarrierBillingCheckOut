### Items Discussion

---- | ---- 
Working Group Management |  
[Issue 44](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/44) | Set to CLOSED. 
[Issue 45](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/45) | Set to CLOSED. Contributed to [Commonalities Pull Request 120](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/120)
[Issue 47](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/47) | Set to CLOSED.
[Issue 54](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/54) | Telefonica proposal to be presented yet, not possible to present this week due to internal matters. That is reason to keep Q1 and Q3 open. Indication of phone_number is foreseen as needed in some scenarios (WiFi, Fixed-Access, where mobile line can not explicitly identified by authentication process). When presenting proposal, rationale will be provided along with it. Ericsson also comments in this way, about the need of msisdn. Pending proposal by Telefonica, expectation is to have it during next week, so presented for the next meeting.
[Issue 55](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/55) | Indication in Payment approach whether amount has taxes. Managed in Carrier Billing Payment by [Pull Request 60](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/60)
[Issue 56](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/56) | Regarding payment relevant dates, proposal done by Orange. Managed in Carrier Billing Payment by [Pull Request 60](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/60)
[Issue 58](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/58) | Keep this topic open until a common view of Error Model is aligned in CAMARA. API Proposals will have to be aligned in that way. Referenced in [Commonalities Issue 151](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/151)
[Issue 61](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/61) | snake_case input/output params in APIs. Generated issue by Orange (separated from Issue 56, where initially mentioned). Commented by Telefonica that mention of align proposals is to be compliant with Commonalities in the way moving forward towards v1.0. Orange indicates they would like to open an Issue in Commonalities to discuss this topic, as there are other approaches in the ecosystem (OMA, TMF,...). Issue opened after meeting [Commonalities Issue 157](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/157).
[Pull Request 60](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/60) | PR generated by Orange to deal with [Issue 55](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/55) and [Issue 56](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/56). Explained both dates (paymentCreationDate and paymentDate) are included as optional in GET /payments and /payments/{id}. Also paymentDate is included in notification, to indicate when payment is effective.<br/> • Ericsson is OK with the proposal as request coming from its side. <br/> • Telefonica is also OK with the proposal, and share view about including paymentDate in notification as it makes sense to have a coherente working proposal.
