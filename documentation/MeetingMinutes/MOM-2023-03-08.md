Item | Discussion
---- | ---- 
[Issue 54](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/54) | Telefonica provides answers for pending questions Q1 and Q3. Issue will continue open until WG review and give approval for [Pull Request 64](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/64) 
[Issue 55](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/55) | Managed in Carrier Billing Payment by [Pull Request 60](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/60). Set to CLOSED.
[Issue 56](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/56) | Managed in Carrier Billing Payment by [Pull Request 60](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/60) and Carrier Billing Checkout by [Pull Request 64](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/64). Set to CLOSED.
[Issue 58](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/58) | Commonalities Error Model is aligned in both proposals Carrier Billing Payment by [Pull Request 60](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/60) and Carrier Billing Checkout by [Pull Request 64](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/64). Set to CLOSED.
[Issue 61](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/61) | snake_case input/output params in APIs. Keep Opened. Being Evaludated in [Commonalities Issue 157](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/157). Once taken a decision, actions will have to be performed within the proposals accordingly.
[Pull Request 60](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/60) | PR generated by Orange to deal with [Issue 55](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/55) and [Issue 56](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/56).<br/> • Minor update change clarified and performed by Orange (remove pattern for HTTP status) during the meeting.<br/> • Telefonica will review and give OK after the meeting. Ready to be merged
[Pull Request 64](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/64) | PR generated by Telefonica to provide functionality for 1-step payment and list of purchases. Besides this, it is taken advantage to also include:<br/>• `payment creation date` and `payment date` concepts in Details of a purchase and List of purchases endpoints.<br/>• In the same fashion, `payment date` concept is also included in notifications endpoint.<br/>• Additionally, `phone number` concept is included in payment body request (for both 1-step and 2-step procedures), as optional input, due to the fact in some authentication scenarios (e.g. Mobile Connect Based, Mobile IP based) phone number can be obtained and therefore that information can be carried within Authorization header. This does NOT mean an implementation can consider this parameter as required always but to explain the rationale of the proposal<br/>• Finally, HTTP `status` pattern is removed to be aligned.<br/><br/> Mentioned to be reviewed by the WG team after the meeting to provide comments and further doubts.<br/> • Orange comments about two topics: The prevalence of the `phone number` request body param over Authorization information and in that way the scenario of having non-matching information between the value carried within this param and the information contained within Authorization header.<br/> • Telefonica indicates the information present in this param is the one to be considered when provided (so it prevails over Authorization header info) to identify the `phone number` to be charged and it is a very good point the one raised about non-matching information between this param and Authorization Header, so it will be reviewed internally.
AoB | Telefonica comments that given both proposals are moving forward to have an aligment at functionality level and pending points are mainly related to Commonalities topics (input/output params format, notificatons approach) it makes sense to move to a bi-weekly meetings model, work offline about proposals and Commonalities alignment and having specific weekly meeting if situation requires for it (relevant topic). Orange shares this view, given that proposals are reaching a common level of maturity and pending points to have a first set of functionality are related to Commonalities topics. WG considers suitable this WoW model and no objection raised. Meetings will be scheduled for the next two months.  


### Next Steps
- Next Meetings:<br/>
  • Agreed to move forward by Bi-weekly meetings. Exceptional weekly meeting could be arranged on demand if any topic of relevance is raised<br/>
	• Next meeting planned for 22th March (same datetime)<br/>
