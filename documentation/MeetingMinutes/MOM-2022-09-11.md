### Items Discussion

Item | Discussion
---- | ----
[Pull Request 7](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/7) | Two User Stories defined, one related to Payment procedure and the other one related to Payment Method Provisioning/Onboarding. About the first one, there are no relevant comments and participants are aligned about it. Regarding the second one, STC comments about some business scenarios (Apple), in which payment method provisioning is needed. On this matter, Orange and Telefonica provide comments in the line that this functionality is not really part of "core" payment functionalty, so this functionality maybe fits in later version or other CAMARA track.
[Issue 10](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/10) | A first set of features are commented to check participants view on them:
[Issue 3](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/3) | Initial API Proposal
