### Items Discussion

Item | Discussion
---- | ----
[Pull Request 7](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/7) | Two User Stories defined, one related to Payment procedure and the other one related to Payment Method Provisioning/Onboarding. About the first one, there are no relevant comments and participants are aligned about it. Regarding the second one, STC comments about some business scenarios (Apple), in which payment method provisioning is needed. On this matter, Orange and Telefonica provide comments in the line that this functionality is not really part of "core" payment functionalty, so this functionality maybe fits in later version or other CAMARA track.
<br>
[Issue 10](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/10) | A first set of features are commented to check participants view on them:<br/> **Individual Purchase/Payment**: • Orange: Model is splitted (purchase/payment). From Orange perspective, priority is payment. Individual Payment is first priority. • STC: Individual Payment is also first priority. • Telefonica: Analogous comment, this feature is first priority<br/>
**Recurrent Purchase/Payment (a.k.a. subscriptions)**: All participants agree on having this feature as a second priority<br>
**OTP Payment validation (2FA SMS OTP)**: All participants have the same view on considering this feature as first priority. • STC also indicates the need to deal with scenarios managed not only by SMS OTP but also via Push Notifications<br/>
**Retrieve Purchase/Payment Details**: All participants agree on having payment details as a first priority feature. Also list of payments is commented as a valuable feature. • In baseline proposal not included the list feature by Telefonica due to the fact of managing payment list between different Apps (scenario: one App cannot see payments performed by other App and viceversa)<br/>
**Refund**: All participants share the view of having this feature as a second priority<br/>
NOTE: Orange indicates within this item the consideration of having 1/2-STEP payment flow approach (i.e. having both options at OBs discretion). Reference Flow: [Link Pending]
