### AoB 

WG next actions:<br/>

• Notifications Guideline Track (initial baseline) is being completed within [Commonalities PR#173](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/173). Once completed, main pending point is to address impact/discussion in current notifications approach. Probably better way is an issue to open discussion over it, before proposing any change if any. That is main point to move proposals towards a v1.0 (apart from documentation topics).<br/> 

• Documentation track: Pending to incorporate into OpenAPI proposals full autocontained documentation model as per [Commonalities Issue#164](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/164). Orange highlights made a question about images, and it seems it can be possible (in Carrier Billing there are sequence diagrams). Both Orange and Telefonica will make tests to check all information can be accommodated within OpenAPI yaml.<br/>

• Convivence of proposals: Telefonica has commented internally, in order for Business to be aware of situation and for them to be able to do product checkings and also has contacted to have business contacts from some Telco Operators.<br/>

• STC indicates they have some concerns about the proposals and will make some contribution regarding it.


### Next Steps
- Next Meetings:<br/>
  • Agreed to move forward by Bi-weekly meetings. Exceptional weekly meeting could be arranged on demand if any topic of relevance is raised<br/>
  • Next meeting - 26th April - 16:00 CEST
