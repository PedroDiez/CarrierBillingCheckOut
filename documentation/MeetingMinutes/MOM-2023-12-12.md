Comment provided regarding the fact in 1-STEP Payment, SYNC behaviour, `denied` status is not reached, so lifecycle diagram needs to be updated. Pedro (Telefonica) agrees on that, because in such a case an exception would be triggered instead. **AP:** Generate a new PR to update lifecycle diagram so as it can be integarted in current [PR#125](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/125).
