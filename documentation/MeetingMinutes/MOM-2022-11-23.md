[Issue 10](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/10) | Based on that issue, a PR is generated.

[Pull Request 16](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/16) | Orange | Orange explains its proposal for Carrier Billing. Before initiating explanation Telefonica comments about discussion thread in git:<br/> • Telefonica proposal do not include some cases (invoices) as no Use Case so far. Regarding differents payments (for items) for one purchase, in the same fashion. Orange clarifies just making some payments for the items included in a payment.<br/> Orange explains its proposal baseline: Proposal OMA-based, explaining they see a model following OMA body structures guidelines, maybe adding/removing some params to be aligned with Use Cases and provide a simpler interface as possible. Input structures for 1-STEP/2-STEP initiation procedures are analogous, provides initial explanation about semantic of params. Maybe responses could be simplified. Some comments around some params raised from STC (tax_amount, channel) and Telefonica (conceptualization of items in model). PurchaseId could be included as an addition of OMA-based input.<br/>Situation: This proposal has a different approach with regards to Telefonica one [Issue 3](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/3), whose baseline is [Pull Request 4](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/4). Orange sees Purchase/Payment as different business concepts whilst Telefonica considers Purchase as the object that models the concept to be paid and the payment the action of charging for it. Telefonica needs to check internally this approach in order to provide feedback and comment if it can be accepted.
