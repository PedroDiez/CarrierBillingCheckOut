### Items Discussion

Item | Discussion
---- | ---- 
[Issue#97](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/97) | Improvements for Carrier Billing. Limited scope to topic of **Enhancement of the look & feel** (Notifications aligment covered in [Issue#112](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/112). Action Point to Pedro to provide info to the WG. Deadline is 16th October
[Issue#104](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/104) | Issue opened externally. Good to be tracked. Fair request from a technical perspective.<br> • TEF (Pedro) comments in advance TEF Product side will probably ask for this functionality during this year.<br> • ORA (Ludovic) will also check for Product view internally.<br>Commented during the meeting the product side could be trickier (depending on country regulations for example). Need to be addressed after tackling current issues in progress. Comments from the team are welcome. Need to synch with GSMA OGW product stream which manage API requirement drop.<br> • STC (Mohamed) raised a question about managing technical issue where we have several payments for same interaction. Scenario can be managed with the use of the `clientCorrelator` field so as we should not have this problem.<br> • STC (Mohamed) also explained the requirement for reversal vs refund. There are distinctions between reversal (time-limited, in case of STC is End Of Business Day, this is to reverse a payment, the merchant will not get charged for this) and refund (this is a new transaction independent from a payment, merchant is charged for that). This is a good point for Refund thread. Action Point for Mohamed to comment in the issue.
[Issue#105](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/105) | DT (Rafał) introduces the topic. It aims for modeling amounts in a way it may be used worldwide, allowing to tackle the disparity of decimal (0,2,3) in different countries around the world. Proposal here is to use long integer for amount and depending on the currency we deduct the decimal. WG agrees to gather more feedback on this issue and continue discussion.
[Issue#106](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/106) | Issue to deal with Commonalities guideline of having full API documentation within API Spec. TEF (Pedro) will use our initial Markdown documentation & incorporate it (and refresh) in the yaml, generating a new PR. Further updates would be required based on output of other issues discussion (e.g. [Issue#110](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/110)). Agreed by the team.
[Issue#107](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/107) | Issue opened to reflect the fact that other endpoints (`preparePayment`, `confirmPayment`) has the same scenario of a non-existing Payment Identifier as `retrievePayment`, so 404 NOT_FOUND exception is needed. Agreed by the team, to be handled in same PR than [Issue#106](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/106).
[Issue#108](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/108) | Dealing with two Commonalities topics alignment:<br> • **securitySchema**: need to wait Commonalities (or TSC) outcomes - Commonalities PR: [Commonalities#57](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/pull/57).<br> • **scopes**: we can go with the way proposed in the issue and proceed within the same PR.
[Issue#109](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/109) | Issue driven by implementation feedback. Case risen due to the fact no filter criteria is mandatory to be provided, to have an alignment about given response. Use of page/perPage is defined Commonalities. The proposal here is to provide default value, so we can also improve performance in the response time.<br> • ORA (Ludovic) indicates we need probably another error code when the request is too vague/wide (too many records match the filtering criteria), for instance, payments whose "transactionOperationStatus" is equal to "succeeded". Given also the fact the initial baseline was to return all registries when no filter criteria was indicated. Additional thinking is required regarding this issue.
[Issue#110](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/110) | Trigger is the identification of "denied" scenarios in 2-STEP Payment (i.e. user is blocked when trying to confirm payment). Based on that, also other points are covered for alignment of lifecycle understanding. Further discussion / thinking is required on this. Some points compiled so far:<br> • Exception 403 Payment Denied for two-step confirmPayment<br> • Discussion on sync one-step payment: probably the only state is succeeded when the payment resource is created while for async we can have Denied (from Processing state). This is not reflected on the current state engine.<br> • A new event is required for Payment denied. Team agreed.<br> • Discussion about when the balance is checked for the two-step payment: When the payment is `reserved` the money is blocked.
[Issue#111](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/111) | Not covered during the meeting. To be handled in next meeting. Kindly ask offine review.
[Issue#112](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/112) | ORA (Ludovic) remarks the need of Notifications alignment with commonalities. It is needed to be covered. Agreed by the team. To be considered within PR. Pedro and Ludovic will talk offline to manage PR(s) in the best way.
