Item | Discussion
---- | ---- 
WG Status | • **Linter rules**: Applied in WG.<br> • Begin work about refunds
[Issue#148](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/148) | Issue opened to apply Linter rules in Carrier Billing WG repository, set to `CLOSED`. Related [PR#149](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/149) approved and `MERGED`.
[Issue#104](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/104) | Telefónica comments about the main requirements requested by their business and compiled within the Issue. Also commented during the meeting and include later the requirement of obtaining the balance of a given payment (which amount is not refunded). Some comments and considerations provided by Orange (Ludovic):<br> • From Business perspective flow is delegated in Payment Aggregators with deals with the specific details of a given market and latter request in a homogeneous way to the Operator.<br> • Even some Operators (e.g. Telefonica case) the amount refunded cannot exceed payment amount, we should not impose that as a general rule for any implementation as it may be business cases where for customer inconveniences, the amount refunded could be higher (e.g. to enforce trustability / fidelization from the customer).<br> •  With regards to asynchronism, it is asked whether refers to a 2-STEP procedure like payments. It is clarified that not related to a 2-STEP process but to design the solution to work with notifications as refund procedure could take some time before being committed.<br> • Regarding API design, Orange comments about other option to model endpoint(s) in a way refering to the payment involved in the path: `/payments/{paymentId}/refunds`.
