### Items Discussion

Item | Discussion
---- | ----
[Pull Request 7](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/7) | Agreed User Story defined related to Payment procedure. Pending Details to be completed. New one about Obtain Payment(s) Details should be added.
[Issue 10](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/10) | Features grouping in phases talked in the meeting. Orange and Telefonica OK with that grouping. STC to provide feedback by tomorrow (17/11). 
[Issue 3](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/issues/3) | Initial API Proposal.<br/> • Telefonica comments CAMARA Steerco guideline to have draft proposal by 18/11. Proposes to merge initial v0.1.0 with Disclaimer is draft proposal, because there are points to be still analyzed/discussed. Will wait for STC tomorrow feedback to make initial adjustments prior to merge<br/> • **Purchase/Payment**: Telefonica comments its proposal is to keep purchase concept and Orange comments do not see purchase concept in the model. So OPEN point for further discussion. Orange also indicates in the meeting it will provide a swagger contribution without purchase concept to help understanding of this different approach. Provided after the meeting in [Pull Request 16](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/pull/16)<br/> • **1-step/2-step**: Up to OBs discretion, both would be allowed. 1-STEP: payment performed in 1 interaction (confirm-execute). 2-STEP: payment performed in 2 interactions (prepare/confirm-execute). CancelPayment procedure only applies in a 2-STEP model. [Reference Flow](https://github.com/camaraproject/CarrierBillingCheckOut/blob/main/documentation/SupportingDocuments/Carrier%20Billing%20sequence%20diagram.png) <br/> • **otp_validation**: In 1-step, initially would fit into procedure response. In 2-step, it would apply in preparePayment response. Better to see in a flow. <br/> • **User identification**. Raised by STC in order to provide MSISDN. Telefonica explains Use Case is Mobile access so OB Mobile IP authentication features would identify MSISDN subscription. Then that can be associated (outside API scope) to Authorization issued, so MSISDN is not really required to be indicated. Orange shares STC concern about the issue 3 as they have scenario where the API requester could be another party and then a MSISDN or an end user id must be available in the request.
