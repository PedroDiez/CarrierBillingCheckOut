# Overview

<span class="colour" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The Carrier Billing Payment API provides programmable interface for developers and other users (capabilities consumers) to charge
 a digital content purchase or subscription to the mobile line invoice.  </span> 

## 1\. Introduction


The Carrier Billing Payment API is used by an application to charge an amount on the 
mobile line. It can be easily integrated ans used through this secured API and 
allows end-users to buy digital content in an easy & secured way. The API provides management of a payment entity and its associated lifecycle. 

The carrier billing Payment API is driven from Open Mobile Alliance standard.


## 2\. Quick Start

The usage of the API is based on Payment resource, which can be created (in 1 or 2 steps), confirmed (for 2-steps process), cancelled (for 2-steps process), queried and retrieved.


Before starting to use the API, the developer needs to know about the below specified details:

**payment service endpoint**
The URL pointing to the RESTful resource of the payment API.
As we manage 1-step and 2-steps process we have defined 2 separate tags to explicilty
distinct them in the swagger. A third tage 'payment' is defined for common operations for
both process (query & retrieve)

**Authentication**
Security access keys such as OAuth 2.0 client credentials used by Client applications to invoke the Carrier Billing Payment API.

**1-Step & 2-Steps**
1-Step process is very simple: The request intent is to charge an amount to the mobile line. When the server the request, it will check account associated with this line and if nothing prevent it, the amount is charged and will be bill in next invoice or removed from line credit.
For 2-steps, the first call is to request a payment preparation. The amount is not charged and the server has to be ready to get a confirmation or a cancellation to perform the payment. Only when the confirmation is done, payment is charged. Depending on business rules of the Telco operator, a 'prepared' payment could expire after n days.

**Identifier for the the mobile line to be charged**
In order to identify the mobile line to be chaged an identifer must be provided. This identifies is mapped to the endUserId attribute.


**Notification URL**
Developers may provide a callback URL on which status change notifications regarding the payment can be received from the service provider. This is an optional parameter.



Sample API invocations are presented in Section 4.6.

## 3\. Authentication and Authorization

The Carrier Billing Payment API makes use of the OAUTH 2.0 client credentials grant which is applicable for server to server use cases involving trusted partners
or clients without any protected user data involved.
In this method the API invoker client is registered as a confidential client with an authorization grant type of client_credentials [[1]](#1).

### 4.1 API Version

0.5.0

### 4.2 Details

#### 4.2.1 API sequencing

As described above, the API accomodates 2 distinc processes: one step process (direct request to charge) and two steps process (which requires an intermediate step to confirm/cancel a payment request)

Following diagram shows the API resources operation sequencing
